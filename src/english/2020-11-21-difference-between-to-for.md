We say: _I'm studying every day to (~~for~~) improve my English_

The prepositions TO and FOR are very easy to confuse! Here are some rules:

## Use TO In These Cases

**Destination**

*We're going to Paris*

**What time it is**

_It's a quarter to 2_

**Distance**

_It's about ten miles from my house to the university_

**Comparing**

_I prefer sleeping to working_

**Giving**

_I gave the book to my sister_

**Motive/Reason with verb**

_I came here to see you_

**Function with verb (to form)**

_A ladle is a big spoon used to serve soup_


## Use FOR In These Cases

**Benefits**

_Yogurt is good for your digestion_

**Period of time**

_We're lived here for 2 years_

**Schedule**

_I made an appointment for May 3_

**Agree with**

_Are you for or against the development of nuclear weapons?_

**Doing something to help someone**

_Could you carry these books for me?_

**Motive/Reason with noun**

_Let's go out for a drink_

**Function with verb (-ing form)**

_A ladle is a big spoon used for serving soup_

As you can see when talking about Motive/Reason use

- to + verb
    + _I came to New York to work_
- for + noun
    + _I came to New York for a new job_

when talk about Function we can use TO or FOR

- to + base form
    + _This machine is used to make copies_
- for + ing form
    + _This machine is used for making copies_
